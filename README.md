# byte-modifier
C++ Programm that add or sub to each byte of the binary of any file.

# why ?
Actually, it is not very useful, but in some cases it can be revealant.
E.g.: Sending "encrypted" files via mail (will not be blocked).

# encrypting file with it ?
I do not recommend to encrypt file because the bit modification range is 255.
